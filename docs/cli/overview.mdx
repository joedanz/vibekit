## What is the VibeKit CLI?

The VibeKit CLI (`vibekit`) is a powerful command-line tool that enables developers to:

- ðŸš€ **Create and manage sandbox environments** for isolated development
- ðŸ¤– **Generate code using AI agents** (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and more)
- ðŸ’» **Execute commands** in sandboxed environments
- ðŸ”€ **Create pull requests** directly from your environments
- ðŸ”§ **Configure providers** (E2B, Dagger, Daytona, Northflank)

## Architecture

The VibeKit CLI acts as a unified interface to:

1. **Sandbox Providers** - Manage isolated development environments
2. **AI Agents** - Generate and modify code using various AI models
3. **Version Control** - Integrate with GitHub for seamless workflows
4. **Local Development** - Execute commands and interact with your code

## Quick Example

Here's a typical workflow with the VibeKit CLI:

```bash
# 1. Initialize VibeKit with your preferred providers
vibekit init

# 2. Create a new environment with Claude
vibekit local create --name my-project --agent claude

# 3. Generate code using AI
vibekit local generate -e my-project -p "Create a REST API with authentication"

# 4. Execute commands in the environment
vibekit local exec -e my-project -c "npm install && npm test"

# 5. Create a pull request
vibekit local pr -e my-project --title "Add authentication API"
```

## Why Use the CLI?

### For Individual Developers
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Generate boilerplate code and scaffolding instantly
- **Safe Experimentation**: Test changes in isolated environments
- **AI Assistance**: Get help with complex coding tasks

### For Teams
- **Consistent Environments**: Everyone works with the same setup
- **Collaborative AI**: Share AI-generated solutions across the team
- **Automated Workflows**: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines

### For Open Source
- **Easy Contributions**: Contributors can quickly set up development environments
- **AI-Powered Reviews**: Generate code improvements and suggestions
- **Sandbox Testing**: Test contributions in isolated environments

## CLI Structure

The VibeKit CLI is organized into two main commands:

1. **`vibekit init`** - Set up providers and configure your environment
2. **`vibekit local`** - Manage local sandbox environments with subcommands for:
   - Creating and deleting environments
   - Executing commands
   - Generating code with AI
   - Creating pull requests
   - And more...
