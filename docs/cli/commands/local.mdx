## Overview

The `vibekit local` command is the primary interface for managing sandbox environments. It provides subcommands for creating, managing, and interacting with isolated development environments powered by AI agents.

## Syntax

```bash
vibekit local <subcommand> [options]
```

## Subcommands

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [`create`](/cli/commands/local/create) | Create a new sandbox environment |
| [`list`](/cli/commands/local/list) | List all sandbox environments |
| [`exec`](/cli/commands/local/exec) | Execute commands in an environment |
| [`generate`](/cli/commands/local/generate) | Generate code using AI agents |
| [`pr`](/cli/commands/local/pr) | Create a pull request from environment |
| [`connect`](/cli/commands/local/connect) | Connect to environment shell |
| [`status`](/cli/commands/local/status) | Show environment status and health |
| [`logs`](/cli/commands/local/logs) | Display environment logs |
| [`delete`](/cli/commands/local/delete) | Delete sandbox environments |
| `run` | Legacy alias for `exec` command |
| `help` | Show help for local commands |

## Quick Examples

```bash
# Create a new environment
vibekit local create --name dev-env --agent claude

# List all environments
vibekit local list

# Generate code
vibekit local generate -e dev-env -p "Add user authentication"

# Execute a command
vibekit local exec -e dev-env -c "npm test"

# Connect to environment
vibekit local connect -e dev-env

# Delete environment
vibekit local delete dev-env
```

## Environment Concepts

### Environment Lifecycle

1. **Create** - Initialize a new isolated environment with your chosen AI agent
2. **Use** - Execute commands, generate code, and develop in the sandbox
3. **Connect** - Get interactive shell access when needed
4. **PR** - Create pull requests with your changes
5. **Delete** - Clean up when done

### Environment States

- **running** - Active and ready for commands
- **stopped** - Inactive but preserved
- **paused** - Temporarily suspended
- **error** - Failed state requiring attention

## Common Workflows

### Feature Development

```bash
# Create environment for new feature
vibekit local create --name feature-auth --agent claude

# Generate initial code
vibekit local generate -e feature-auth -p "Create JWT authentication"

# Test the implementation
vibekit local exec -e feature-auth -c "npm test"

# Create pull request
vibekit local pr -e feature-auth --title "Add authentication"

# Clean up
vibekit local delete feature-auth
```

### Quick Debugging

```bash
# Create, connect, and investigate
vibekit local create --name debug --agent codex
vibekit local connect -e debug
# ... debug interactively ...
vibekit local delete debug --force
```

## Tips

- **Naming** - Use descriptive names like `feature-<name>` or `bugfix-<issue>`
- **Cleanup** - Regularly delete unused environments with `vibekit local delete`
- **Resources** - Environments persist until explicitly deleted
- **Multiple Environments** - Create separate environments for parallel work
