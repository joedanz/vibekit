## Why Use VibeKit CLI?

Instead of running coding agents directly on your machine, VibeKit provides crucial safety and visibility:

- **Zero Risk**: Isolated Docker containers prevent any damage to your local environment
- **Security First**: Built-in redaction removes sensitive data from agent completions automatically  
- **Full Visibility**: Complete observability into what your coding agents are actually doing
- **Works Offline**: No cloud dependencies or internet required — works entirely on your machine

Whether you're using Claude Code for development, integrating AI agents into your workflow, or building applications that need secure code execution, VibeKit CLI provides the safety foundation you need to use coding agents with confidence.
