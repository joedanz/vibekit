## How it works

VibeKit runs Qwen Code in headless mode with the `--yolo` flag enabled. This means that the agent will automatically create, edit and delete files if it's in `code` mode.

The Qwen Code CLI is ran in the configured environment and has access to the network, which means it could be used to connect to the outside world. This is a powerful feature that can be used to build powerful applications and should be used with caution.

## Available Models

Qwen Code supports various models through different providers:

- `qwen3-coder-plus` (default) - Latest coding model with enhanced capabilities
- `qwen-coder-turbo` - Fast response model optimized for speed
- `qwen-max` - Most capable model for complex tasks
- `qwen-plus` - Balanced model for general use

The model can be specified in your configuration regardless of the authentication method used.

## Authentication

Qwen Code uses OpenAI-compatible API authentication through Alibaba Cloud's services. The specific endpoint and model depend on your location and preferred platform.

### Platform Options

Choose the appropriate platform based on your location:

#### For Mainland China Users

**Option 1: Alibaba Cloud Bailian Platform**
- Get API key at: [https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/)
- Recommended for production use

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_bailian_api_key"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
export OPENAI_MODEL="qwen3-coder-plus"
```

**Option 2: ModelScope Platform**
- Get API key at: [https://modelscope.cn/docs/model-service/API-Inference/intro](https://modelscope.cn/docs/model-service/API-Inference/intro)
- Offers 2,000 free API calls per day
- Great for development and testing

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_modelscope_api_key"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api-inference.modelscope.cn/v1"
export OPENAI_MODEL="Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct"
```

#### For International Users

**Alibaba Cloud ModelStudio**
- Get API key at: [https://modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com/](https://modelstudio.console.alibabacloud.com/)

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_modelstudio_api_key"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
export OPENAI_MODEL="qwen3-coder-plus"
```

### VibeKit Integration

Once you have your API key and endpoint configured, use Qwen with VibeKit:

```typescript
import { VibeKit } from '@vibe-kit/sdk';

const vibeKit = new VibeKit()
  .withAgent({
    type: "qwen",
    provider: "openai", // Always use "openai" for Qwen (OpenAI-compatible)
    providerApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    model: process.env.OPENAI_MODEL || "qwen3-coder-plus",
  })
  .withSandbox("local")
  .withWorkingDirectory("/workspace");

// Initialize and use
const agent = await vibeKit.initialize();
const result = await agent.generateCode("Create a simple web server in Node.js", "code");
```

### Configuration File

Create a `.env` file in your project root with your chosen platform configuration:

```bash
# .env file - Choose one platform configuration

# For Mainland China - Bailian Platform (Recommended)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_bailian_api_key
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
OPENAI_MODEL=qwen3-coder-plus

# For Mainland China - ModelScope Platform (Free tier)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_modelscope_api_key
# OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api-inference.modelscope.cn/v1
# OPENAI_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct

# For International Users - ModelStudio
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_modelstudio_api_key
# OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
# OPENAI_MODEL=qwen3-coder-plus
```

### Getting Your API Key

1. **Choose your platform** based on your location (see Platform Options above)
2. **Register an account** on the chosen platform
3. **Navigate to the API section** and create a new API key
4. **Set the environment variables** as shown in the configuration examples
5. **Verify your setup** by running a simple test with VibeKit
