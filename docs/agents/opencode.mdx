## How it works

VibeKit runs Opencode in headless mode. This means that the agent will automatically create, edit and delete files if it's in `code`Â mode.

The Opencode CLI runs in the configured environment and has access to the network, which means it could be used to connect to the outside world. This is a powerful feature that can be used to build powerful applications and should be used with caution.
