VibeKit supports streaming responses, allowing you to receive data from the API in real-time as it is generated. This is particularly useful for applications that require immediate feedback or want to display results incrementally.

## Overview

Streaming enables your application to process and display data as soon as it is available, rather than waiting for the entire response. This can improve user experience and reduce perceived latency.

## How to Use Streaming

To enable streaming with the `generateCode` method, use the event-driven approach with `.on()` listeners. The API will emit events as data is generated.

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { VibeKit } from "@vibe-kit/sdk";
import { createE2BProvider } from "@vibe-kit/e2b";

const e2bProvider = createE2BProvider({
  apiKey: process.env.E2B_API_KEY!,
  templateId: "vibekit-claude",
});

const vibeKit = new VibeKit()
  .withAgent({
    type: "claude",
    provider: "anthropic",
    apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY!,
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  })
  .withSandbox(e2bProvider);

// Set up event listeners for streaming
vibeKit.on("update", (message) => {
  // Handle streaming updates
  console.log('Streaming update:', message);
  // Update your UI with the new content
  updateUI(message);
});

vibeKit.on("error", (error) => {
  // Handle streaming errors
  console.error('Streaming error:', error);
});

// Generate code
const response = await vibeKit.generateCode({
  prompt: "Create a React component for a todo list",
  mode: "code",
});

// The final response is still available
console.log('Final response:', response);
```

### With Conversation History

```typescript
// Event listeners are already set up from previous example
vibeKit.on("update", (message) => {
  // Display incremental updates to the user
  appendToOutput(message);
});

const response = await vibeKit.generateCode({
  prompt: "Now add error handling to the component",
  mode: "code",
  history: previousConversation,
});
```

## When to Use Streaming

- When you want to display results to users as soon as they are available
- For long-running code generation tasks where incremental updates improve UX
- For interactive coding sessions where immediate feedback is valuable
- For chatbots or Q&A mode where responses can be shown progressively

## Streaming Events

VibeKit uses an event-driven approach for streaming with the following events:

| Event | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `update` | `(message: string) => void` | Emitted with streaming content updates as they are generated |
| `error` | `(error: string) => void` | Emitted when errors occur during streaming |

## Notes

- Streaming is available for both "ask" and "code" modes
- The final response is still returned as a Promise, even when using streaming events
- Event listeners are optional - you can use the method without them for non-streaming behavior
- Handle errors appropriately in your `error` event listener to provide good user experience
